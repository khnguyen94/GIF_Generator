## Usage
- We have provided a few stock celebrities for users to get an idea of what they can get from our application
- At the top, we have a search bar where users can add to the list of celebrities they can find GIFs for
    - When a user searches for a new celebrity, that new celebrity will be added as to keep a running record in addition to a set of GIFs being returned for that celebrity of interest
- Previously added celebrities can be reaccessed for their associated GIFs
- As to not overload the browser window, we have implemented an on-click functionality to our GIF photos. Initially, all GIFs are rendered as still images. When the user clicks on a still GIF image, it will switch over to the GIF clip (traditional moving GIFs as we know it)

## Importance
This app provides some additional funcitonality in comparison to the GIPHY UI:
- By maintaining a history of recently searched celebrities, users can see and revisit their GIFs searches
